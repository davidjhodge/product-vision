# ProductVision
Product Vision uses barcode scanning to find similar items from other retailers. Built with ReactNative.

-- David's Notes --

First and foremost, get ReactNative [set up](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

To run the project on ios,
```
react-native run-ios
```

To run on android,
```
react-native run-android
```

All of the source code is contained in the **src folder**.

No need to edit anything directly in the android or ios folder.
